Wordle is a New York Times crossword puzzle that is popular around the world. Although the rules of the game are simple, the process of finding a solution contains profound mathematical knowledge, such as probability and information entropy, and the game itself has attracted a lot of attention. Every day, a large number of players report their game results on Twitter, which are automatically collated and made public by the Twitter account Wordle Stats.

Based on a subset of these data (from January 7 to December 31, 2022), the following work is done:

- Model the number of daily reporting results and predict the number of reports on March 1, 2023.
- Analyze which features of the result percentage of word speculation is related to the word itself, establish the model of the result percentage for these features, and predict the result percentage distribution of the word $\tt eerie$ on March 1, 2023.
- Build a word difficulty evaluation model, and evaluate the difficulty of the word $\tt eerie$ according to the predicted results.
- Do other analysis on the data.

Finally, the core results of all the above work will be summarized in a letter to the editor of the New York Times, so as to reflect the practical and application value of this paper.
